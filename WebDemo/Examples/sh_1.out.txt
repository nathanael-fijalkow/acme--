The input automaton is a classical automaton. Stamina will compute its star height.
It first finds an upper bound using the Loop Complexity heuristics, and then proceeds with the star height computation.

************LOOP COMPLEXITY******************

According to the Loop Complexity heuristics, the star-height is at most 1.
A regular expression for the language (omitting epsilon) is:  (aa+aa(aa)*aa)
The Loop Complexity suggests the following unboundedness witness:   aa(aa)^#aa

************STAR HEIGHT COMPUTATION**********

******************************
Testing star height 0
******************************

RESULTS: the star height is 1, as predicted by the Loop Complexity heuristics, and a regular expression witnessing it is (aa+aa(aa)*aa).
